# AWS-SAM-CLI

## Lab Description

The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) CLI is a tool to build serverless applications that are defined using AWS SAM templates. The CLI consists of commands that allow you to define, test, and deploy your serverless applications.
In this lab, I worked with the AWS SAM CLI in an IDE environment that is configured to an AWS account. The IDE environment will allowed initialize, configure, and deploy a quick start application to AWS, without using the AWS console directly. I deployed a simple Hello World application to experience the easy-to-use commands provided by the AWS SAM CLI.

## Learning objectives

1. Initialize an AWS SAM project
